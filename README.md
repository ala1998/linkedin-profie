## ✍🏻 LinkedIn Post

Below is a short professional LinkedIn post reflecting my goals and recent accomplishments:

🏆 𝐖𝐢𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 1𝐬𝐭 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐞 at the 𝐖𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐈𝐧<𝐂𝐓𝐑𝐋> Hackathon was more than a prize — it was an 𝐮𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 experience. 

𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐞 days. 𝟓𝟎+ brilliant women. 𝐄𝐧𝐝𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 ideas. 𝐎𝐧𝐞 𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐝𝐢𝐛𝐥𝐞 journey!

I had the chance to pitch a startup idea and prototype, alongside my amazing team, tackling unemployment in the medical field and speeding up emergency care. 

During the hackathon, I pushed my limits, tested assumptions, and learned to experiment, iterate, and collaborate fearlessly. Being surrounded by women from diverse fields — tech, business, pharmacy, nursing, and more — showed me that different perspectives drive stronger, more creative solutions.

Beyond the challenge, it was a win in fun, social energy, and the spirit of a family of innovative women. 

A huge thank you to the organizers — Nadiah Sabaneh & Ghena Masri from FINOMENA (Female Innovators & Investors of MENA) and Ambar Amleh, Reem Qawasmi & Dana Mattour from Ibtikar Fund — for creating such an 𝐞𝐦𝐩𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠, and 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐬𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 space. 

And to the mentors and judges — Nour Asfour, Samia Elwan, Dunia Saffarini, Samah Ayyad, Eng. Tasneem R. Yosuef, Majd Khalifeh, Dr. Maysoun Ibrahim, Alaa Fatayer, Huda Tahboub, Diala Khashan, and Malak Duraidi — your 𝐢𝐧𝐬𝐩𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐬, guidance, and support made this journey truly 𝐦𝐞𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞. 

In the end, it wasn’t just a hackathon — it was proof that women can do 𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐭𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠✨❤️.
